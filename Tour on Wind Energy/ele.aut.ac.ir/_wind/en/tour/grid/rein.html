      The buyer of a wind turbine does not need to concern himself
      with local technical regulations for wind turbines and other
      equipment connected to the electrical grid. This responsibility
      is generally left to the turbine manufacturer and the local power
      company.<BR>

      we go into some of the electrotechnical issues involved in connecting
      a turbine to the grid on this page.</P>

      <P>The term &quot;power quality&quot; refers to the voltage stability,
      frequency stability, and the absence of various forms of electrical
      noise (e.g. flicker or harmonic distortion) on the electrical
      grid. More broadly speaking, power companies (and their customers)
      prefer an alternating current with a nice sinusoidal shape, such
      as the one in the image above. (If you are not familiar with
      the basics of alternating current (AC) it may be useful to consult
      the <A HREF="http://ele.aut.ac.ir/~wind/en/stat/unitsac.htm">Reference Manual</A> about
      this subject before continuing).</P>

      (and Stopping) a Turbine</FONT></B><BR>
      Most electronic wind turbine controllers are programmed to let
      the turbine run idle without grid connection at low wind speeds.
      (If it were grid connected at low wind speeds, it would in fact
      run as a motor, as you can read about on the <A HREF="../wtrb/electric.html">generator
      page</A>). Once the wind becomes powerful enough to turn the
      rotor and generator at their rated speed, it is important that
      the turbine generator becomes connected to the electrical grid
      at the right moment.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Otherwise there will be only the mechanical
      resistance in the gearbox and generator to prevent the rotor
      from accelerating, and eventually overspeeding. (There are several
      safety devices, including fail-safe brakes, in case the correct
      start procedure fails, which you may have read in the section
      on <A HREF="../wtrb/safety.html">Wind Turbine Safety</A>).</P>

      Starting with Thyristors</FONT></B><BR>
      If you switched a large wind turbine on to the grid with a normal
      switch, the neighbours would see a brownout (because of the current
      required to magnetise the generator) followed by a power peak
      due to the generator current surging into the grid. You may see
      the situation in the drawing in the accompanying browser window,
      where you see the flickering of the lamp when you operate the
      switch to start the wind turbine. The same effect can possibly
      be seen when you switch on your computer, and the transformer
      in its power supply all of a sudden becomes magnetised.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Another unpleasant side effect of using a
      &quot;hard&quot; switch would be to put a lot of extra wear on
      the gearbox, since the cut-in of the generator would work as
      if you all of a sudden slammed on the mechanical brake of the
      turbine.

      i.e. they connect and disconnect gradually to the grid using

      which may be controlled electronically. (You may in fact have
      a thyristor in your own home, if you own a modern light dimmer,
      where you can adjust the voltage on your lamps continuously).<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Thyristors waste about 1 to 2 per cent of
      the energy running through them. Modern wind turbines are therefore
      normally equipped with a so called <B>bypass switch</B>, i.e.
      a mechanical switch which is activated after the turbine has
      been soft started. In this way the amount of energy wasted will
      be minimised.</P>

      If a turbine is connected to a weak electrical grid, (i.e. it
      is vary far away in a remote corner of the electrical grid with
      a low power-carrying ability), there may be some brownout / power
      surge problems of the sort mentioned above. In such cases it
      may be necessary to reinforce the grid, in order to carry the
      fluctuating current from the wind turbine.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Your local power company has experience in
      dealing with these potential problems, because they are the exact
      mirror-image of connecting a large electricity user, (e.g. a
      factory with large electrical motors) to the grid.</P>

      <P><A NAME="flicker"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#0066cc" SIZE="+1" FACE="gillsans, frutiger, arial, helvetica, geneva">Flicker<BR>
      </FONT>Flicker</B> is an engineering expression for short lived
      voltage variations in the electrical grid which may cause light
      bulbs to flicker. This phenomenon may be relevant if a wind turbine
      is connected to a weak grid, since short-lived wind variations
      will cause variations in power output. There are various ways
      of dealing with this issue in the design of the turbine, mechanically,
      electrically, and using power electronics.</P>

      <P><A NAME="islanding"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#0066cc" SIZE="+1"
       FACE="gillsans, frutiger, arial, helvetica, geneva">Preventing
      &quot;Islanding&quot;<BR>
      </FONT>Islanding</B> is a situation which may occur if a section
      of the electrical grid becomes disconnected from the main electrical
      grid, e.g. because of accidental or intended tripping of a large
      circuit breaker in the grid (e.g. due to lightning strikes or
      short circuits in the grid). If wind turbines keep on running
      in the isolated part of the grid, then it is very likely that
      the two separate grids will not be <A HREF="http://ele.aut.ac.ir/~wind/en/stat/unitsac.htm#phase">in
      phase</A> after a short while.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Once the connection to the main grid is re-established
      it may cause huge current surges in the grid and the wind turbine
      generator. It would also cause a large release of energy in the
      mechanical drive train (i.e. the shafts, the gear box and the
      rotor of the wind turbine) much like &quot;hard switching&quot;
      the turbine generator onto the grid would do.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">The electronic controller of the wind turbine
      will therefore constantly have to monitor the voltage and frequency
      of the alternating current in the grid. In case the voltage or
      frequency of the local grid drift outside certain limits within
      a fraction of a second, the turbine will automatically disconnect
      from the grid, and stop itself immediately afterwards. (Normally
      by activating the aerodynamic brakes as explained in the section
      on wind <A HREF="../wtrb/safety.html">turbine safety</A>).
