      In order to use the power curve properly, you have to combine
      your knowledge of the Weibull distribution with the power curve.
      This is what we will be doing using the power density calculator
      on the next page:<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">For each tiny 0.1 metre interval of wind
      speeds we multiply the probability of that wind speed interval
      (from the Weibull curve) with the value from the power curve

      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">We then take the sum of all these multiplications

      Use the pop up menu to fill out European wind distribution data
      automatically. The data calculated for roughness classes 0, 1,
      2, and 3 was taken from the European wind atlas. If you use roughness
      class 1.5, we interpolate to find the data. If you have data
      for other parts of the world you would like to have included,

      Density Data</FONT></B><BR>
      As we learned on a previous page, <A HREF="enerwind.html">the
      energy in the wind</A> varies in proportion to the density of
      air. Try changing the air temperature from, say 40 degrees Celsius,
      to -20 degrees Celsius. There are almost 25 per cent more air
      molecules in a cubic metre of the cold air than in a cubic metre
      of the warm air, so watch what happens to the energy output...<BR>

      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">If you wish to change the altitude above
      sea level, then start setting the temperature at sea level first.
      The programme will then automatically compute the likely temperature
      and pressure at the altitude you set.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">You may set the air density directly, if
      you know what you are doing. The programme then computes a likely
      set of data for the other variables. (You may also change the
      air pressure, but you'd better leave it alone. Your air pressure
      obviously has to fit to the local altitude and temperature).</P>

      Distribution Data</FONT></B><BR>
      The <A HREF="weibull.html">Weibull</A> shape parameter is generally
      around 2 in Northern Europe, but situations vary, so you may
      really need a wind atlas to set this more accurately. You can
      either enter the mean wind speed, or the Weibull scale parameter
      (the programme then automatically computes) the other.<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">The measurement height for your wind speed
      is very important, because wind speeds increase with heights
      above ground level, cf. the page on <A HREF="shear.html">wind
      shear</A>. Meteorology observations are generally made at 10
      m height, but anemometer studies are often made at hub height
      of the wind turbine (in our example 50 metres).<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../../r/t.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">The average <A HREF="shear.html#rough">roughness</A>
      of the surrounding terrain is important to determine the wind
      speed at turbine hub height, if it differs from the height at
      which wind speed measurements were made. You may either set the
      roughness length or the roughness class, depending on the local
      landscape type. (See the <A HREF="http://ele.aut.ac.ir/~wind/en/stat/unitsw.htm#roughness">Reference
      Manual</A> for guidelines on roughness classes).
